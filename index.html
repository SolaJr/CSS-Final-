	<p>The Texas A &Aacute; M University Corps of Cadets (often The Corps of Cadets, or simply the Corps) is a student military organization at Texas A&Aacute;M University. Established with the University in 1876, it is the oldest student organization on campus. </p>
		
	<p>Students who elect to join the Corps must participate in mandatory Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) courses and training for the first three semesters, but they are optional after that. All cadets are required to attend leadership classes in the School of Military Science coordinated by the Commandant's Office. Approximately 45 percent[1] of the members of the Cadet Corps continue with the ROTC curriculum, contract with the military, and receive commissions as officers in the United States armed forces upon graduation. Juniors and seniors who do not have military contracts to receive commissions but wish to remain members of the Cadet Corps are classified as "Drill & Ceremonies" (D&C) cadets. As established under federal law, Texas A&M is one of six U.S. colleges classified as senior military colleges and is the largest.

  <p>The Corps of Cadets is a student-led, military-style organization at Texas A&M. It is the oldest student organization on campus and was established with the university in 1876. While participation in the Corps of Cadets was at one time mandatory for all who attended Texas A&M, participation in the Corps became voluntary in 1965. However, the Corps of Cadets is a large, visible part of the university and continues to play an important part in Texas A&M’s traditions and history.
  

		The men and women of the Corps of Cadets form the largest uniformed body of students outside of the United States service academies. While Texas A&M’s Corps of Cadets consistently commissions more officers into the country’s military than any other school in the nation except the three service academies, membership in the Corps carries no military obligation.

  	<p>As a member of the Corps, a cadet climbs through four classes of seniority.</p>
  	<h5>Freshmen</h5>
  	<p>Freshman cadets are called "fish". The first year, the "fish year" is analogous to the experiences of the Rooks at Norwich University, Knobs at The Citadel, Rats of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, Rats at the Virginia Military Institute, Frogs at University of North Georgia, Doolies at the United States Air Force Academy, or Plebes at any of the other U.S. Federal Service Academies.

A fish is easily recognized by the fact that the garrison cap (a.k.a. bider) is plain and not embellished with any braid, or by the black cotton belt. The freshman bider is worn with a deep tuck in the back, which forms a "peak" reminiscent of a fish tail, and first-semester freshmen wear brass "A.M.U." devices on their lapels, rather than the Corps insignia or band lyre worn by upperclassmen. Freshmen and sophomores are also required to wear metal taps on the heels of their shoes; this facilitates marching in step.[7] In addition, male fish must maintain an extremely short hairstyle known colloquially as a "fish cut".</p>

	  	<h5>Sophomore</h5>
  	<p></p>  
  <p>Sophomore year is a busy and hectic second year in the Corps. Sophomores in the Corps are known as ... as. "Hissheads", often abbreviated as "head" since cadets do not swear in uniform. Several stories circulate as to the origin of the name. According to legend, the name is derived from an incident in the mid-1900s when a group of freshmen urinated on the heads of several sophomores they had grown tired of. A more recent story credits the nickname to Aggie Bonfire, when sophomores would work on the lower levels of the stack, and the upperclassmen above them would relieve themselves. However, the name predates the stacked bonfire, and it is generally accepted that the name simply refers to the normal demeanor of sophomores in keeping the freshman class in line. A pisshead's primary duty in the Corps is to train and drill the freshmen for Final Review in May, and the pisshead is graded by the performance of his freshmen

  	<p></p>  
    	<h5>Junior</h5>
  	<p></p>  
  <p>As a junior, the cadet is called a "sergebutt" or more commonly just a butt. The nickname is a result of the serge material used to make the uniform trousers. When cadets wore college issue cotton khaki, it was a junior privilege to purchase tailor made serge uniforms which were easier to maintain and required less ironing. The Corps junior, wearing a white braid on their garrison caps and white cotton belts, often finds this to be the most productive and engaging year in the Cadet Corps. The junior class runs the daily operations of the Corps. Juniors hold the rank of cadet sergeant through cadet sergeant major, depending on the position attained.</p>

  	<h5>Senior</h5>
  	<p></p>  
  <p>Senior cadets are often referred to as "zips" (short for "zipperheads"), referring to the black and gold "zipper" braid on the garrison cap. A senior may also be referred to as an "elephant," which derives from the senior class Elephant Walk tradition held the week before the last regularly scheduled football game of the year. Seniors hold cadet officer rank, from Cadet 2nd Lieutenant to Cadet Colonel of the Corps.

<h1>The Duty </h1>

</body>

Col. Bryon Stebbins was in Texas A&M’s Corps of Cadets back in the 1970s, but he can still remember in detail trying to get back to his hometown of Dickinson via a Greyhound bus during a Corps Trip to Houston.

Now interim commandant for the Corps, Stebbins said he’s seen the other side of a Corps Trip operation as almost 2,100 cadets made their way to the Dallas-Fort Worth area this weekend for Texas A&M’s game against Arkansas at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, which the Razorbacks won 20-10.

“It’s an event that they’ll remember for the rest of their lives,” Stebbins said. “I remember mine, a couple of them, like they were yesterday.”

The parents of A&M’s current Corps Commander, Connor Fortier, reside in Flower Mound, meaning Fortier’s family played host to him and eight others, who crashed on couches and cots.

“One of the great parts about the Corps trip and the most fun parts … is usually there’s only a few people you might know that live in Dallas or are from the Dallas area, so one of them is me,” Fortier said. “I’m going to take all my buddies and host them at my house and have a big dinner and a big get-together and hangout. That’s fun cramming into one house and hanging with all of your friends.”

For the first time in over five years, A&M’s Corps of Cadets held a march-in through downtown Fort Worth. Step off was at 9 a.m. with cadets starting the 1-plus mile march at the Fort Worth Convention Center, walking north and in front of the Tarrant County courthouse before heading south through Sundance Square and ending up back at the convention center. All key components of the Corps were present, including the Fightin’ Texas Aggie Band and Parson’s Mounted Cavalry.

Since Saturday’s march-in was slightly longer than the marches before home football games, Fortier said it was good the Corps had two march-ins under its belt this season before going to the “big show” in Fort Worth.

“March-in is already intimidating, at least your first couple ones, when you do it,” Fortier said. “And even for me, being in front is pretty intimidating the first couple of times. And then you put that in a bigger city, a special event with a lot more people, and that can kind of raise the stakes even more.”

Fortier said the Corps’ juniors and seniors have made previous trips to Metroplex, but none had taken part in a march-in in the area, which was a bigger logistical piece. He added that the operations team was adaptable, especially after going through challenges related to COVID-19.

One difference was transporting the Aggie Band. While most Corps members traveled to the Metroplex on Friday, the band had a 4:30 a.m. departure from College Station on Saturday morning so they could travel together.

During march-in, the band played its “big four”: the Aggie War Hymn, the Noble Men of Kyle, Patton and the Ballad of the Green Berets. With a longer march-in, each song was separated by a cadence from the band’s drummers to give other band members a short break from playing.

Once march-in was finished, the band loaded back up into charter buses and drove straight to AT&T Stadium. The Aggie Band performed at halftime and had formed the bottom section of where Corps members sat in the first three levels in the corner of the A&M end zone.

Performing at halftime this season has been amazing, Aggie Band combined band commander Jacob Abell said. The band was limited to recorded halftime drills last season due to the pandemic.

“Even for the people who haven’t done it before, like the freshmen, their senior year of high school they didn’t get to perform with them either,” Abell said. “They came this year super motivated and excited to be a part of something. We’ve had good retention in the band this year just because everyone’s so happy to be able to perform and do what the Aggie Band does.”

Corps Trips date back over 100 years, Stebbins said, adding it can be a good challenge for young adults learning to travel to places on their own.

“They’re young and so you guys can figure out how to get to Fort Worth or Dallas,” Stebbins said. “Figure it out. You’re 18 or 19 years old. It’s not that hard. But it’s one of those things that they’ve never had to figure out.”
